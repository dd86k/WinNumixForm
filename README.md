# WinNumixForm

![sc](http://didi.wilomgfx.net/p/numix2.png)

WinNumixForm is a modified blank WinForm, styled as FormBorderStyle.None, which aims to add a complete implementation of the dark Numix theme written in C# 6.0, for .NET 4.5 (Mono compatible).

May be re-written in the future as a WinForm Customizer (API).
